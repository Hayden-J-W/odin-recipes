    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini or white mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
