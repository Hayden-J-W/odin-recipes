    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth or water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and ground pork to the pot. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes. Drain any excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>If using, pour in the red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes until the wine is reduced by half.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and beef broth (or water) to the pot. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, dried basil, dried oregano, dried thyme, and red pepper flakes (if using). Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let it simmer gently for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the better the flavors will meld together.</li>
        <li>Before serving, taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a bit more beef broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve the sauce over your favorite pasta and garnish with fresh basil or parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Italian Sunday Soup!</li>
